       <p style="font-size: 140%;">Discover the Advantages of Certified Pre-Owned Vehicles:</p><hr>
       <p  style="font-size: 110%;">When you purchase a Certified Pre-Owned Mercedes-Benz, you’re getting excellent value, industry-leading coverage and more. But perhaps the best part of a Certified Pre-Owned Mercedes-Benz is the fact that it’s a Mercedes-Benz. See what’s available near you to join our exclusive family of owners.When the dealer’s technicians undertake a vehicle inspection they start with the exterior, making sure the structure and appearance are up to Mercedes-Benz standards. The interior inspection includes a full review of the finishes, seat belts, flooring and more.<br><br>Next, they evaluate the vehicle’s functionality, thoroughly checking components such as the electrical systems, engine, fluids, filters and transmission. Before any Certified Pre-Owned vehicle is deemed to be ready for the road, all recall campaigns and standard services are completed and the tires meet Mercedes-Benz factory standards.Our Mercedes-Benz technicians understand that the best way to judge a vehicle is to drive it yourself. That’s why they get behind the wheel of every Certified Pre-Owned vehicle to evaluate its steering, brakes, suspension, drive shaft, and overall ride quality. Even the noise and vibration levels are monitored to ensure that the experience behind the wheel is smooth, quiet, and exactly what you expect from the three-pointed star.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 140%;"><u>Quality rankings:</u></p>
        <p style="font-size: 110%;">Mercedes-Benz normally has a strong reputation for quality and durability. Some objective measures looking at passenger vehicles, such as J. D. Power surveys, demonstrated a downturn in reputation in these criteria in the late 1990s and early 2000s. By mid-2005, Mercedes temporarily returned to the industry average for initial quality, a measure of problems after the first 90 days of ownership, according to J. D. Power.[56] In J. D. Power's Initial Quality Study for the first quarter of 2007, Mercedes showed dramatic improvement by climbing from 25th to 5th place and earning several awards for its newer models.[57] For 2008, Mercedes-Benz's initial quality rating improved by yet another mark, to 4th place.[58] On top of this accolade, it also received the Platinum Plant Quality Award for their Mercedes branded Sindelfingen, Germany body assembly plant.[58] J. D. Power's 2011 US Initial Quality and Vehicle Dependability Studies both ranked Mercedes-Benz vehicles above average in build quality and reliability.[59][60] In J. D. Power's United Kingdom Survey in 2011, Mercedes cars were rated above average.[61] Additionally, iSeeCars.com study for Reuters in 2014 found Mercedes to have the lowest vehicle recall rate out of competitors.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 140%;"><u>Electric cars </u></p>
        <p style="font-size: 110%;">Mercedes opened its sixth battery factory in 2018. Critics deemed the marque's EQS sedan a tough competitor to Tesla, Inc.[93][94] The six factories are established across three continents.


            Mercedes-Benz EQC
            The brand has also launched its electric EQ brand with the EQC SUV which was set for production in the year 2019. In September 2018, Mercedes unveiled the EQC, its first fully electric car, at an event in Stockholm.[95][96]
            
            Mercedes unveiled the VISION AVTR at the 2020 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.[97] The car was inspired by the 2009 science fiction film Avatar.[98] Whilst the AVTR is a concept car, it is said to "hold clues on features bound for next-generation Mercedes-Benz cars".[99]
            
            2022 will be the year in which Daimler has said that the company will have invested $11 billion to ensure that every Mercedes-Benz has a fully electric or hybrid version available on the market.[100]
            
            While releasing details of the project, Markus Schäfer said,
            
            "Our electric vehicles will be built in six plants on three continents. We address every market segment: from the smart fortwo seater to the large SUV. The battery is the key component of e-mobility. As batteries are the heart of our electric vehicles we put a great emphasis on building them in our own factories. With our global battery network, we are in an excellent position: As we are close to our vehicle plants we can ensure the optimal supply of production. In case of a short-term high demand in another part of the world our battery factories are also well prepared for export. The electric initiative of Mercedes-Benz Cars is right on track. Our global production network is ready for e-mobility. We are electrifying the future."[101] After Audi declared that it would cut more than 9,000 jobs by 2025, the owner of Mercedes-Benz announced that the company will shed around 10,000 jobs worldwide to focus on electric cars.[102]
            
            In January 2021, Mercedes-Benz revealed its new electric SUV, the EQA, which will have a range of 426 kilometres and will be on sale in Europe starting 4 February.[103]</p>
